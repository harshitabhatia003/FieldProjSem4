                It started with a train station, unsupervised children, and a realization we couldn't ignore.

                  During our regular commutes back home, we began noticing young children playing dangerously close to the railway tracks - 
                  their parents absent, struggling with addiction or forced into sex work. These weren't just passing observations; 
                  they were heartbreaking encounters that kept us awake at night.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  We realized these children weren't simply "playing" - they were surviving. Their parents, often single mothers battling 
                  unimaginable hardships, lacked the support systems needed to break the cycle. The more we learned, the more compelled 
                  we felt to act.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  ParentPlus emerged from this urgent need - to create a safety net for single parents and their children, providing 
                  resources, community, and most importantly, hope.
